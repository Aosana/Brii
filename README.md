# Introduction

"Qethsegol vahrukiv paaz kulaas Yrsa, wo ensosin pah do Taazokaan voth ek Dun ahrk **brii**."

Brii is a Wabbajack modlist for The Elder Scrolls V: Anniversary Edition that is built and balanced around [SimonMagus616](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746)'s suite of mods. With a plethora of vanilla-styled graphical enhancements, quest expansions, dialogue additions, and gameplay overhauls, Brii offers a relatively simplistic overhaul of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition that does not stray too far from the vanilla game.

## List Contents

Brii contains nearly 1,000 mods that have been patched and tested extensively with one another. For a full list of the mods found in Brii, check out the Load Order Library [here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/brii)!

## System Specs

I play Brii with the following computer specs:

* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700G with Radeon Graphics @ 3.80 GHz
* GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080
* RAM: 32 GB

I get a consistent 60 FPS at every location in the game; however, your mileage may vary depending on your hardware. If you have issues with performance, please let me know as I may be able to help you!

## Skyrim: Anniversary Edition (AE)

Brii requires the _**full**_ Anniversary Edition of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. If you have The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition, then you can purchase the Anniversary Edition upgrade [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade/). If you do not yet own The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition, then you can buy the entirety of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition [here](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/626153). Please ensure that your game is up-to-date before attempting to install Brii!

# Installation

Installation is handled through [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) with a one-click install of the modlist; however, there are some pre-installation steps that must be followed for first-time users.

## Pre-Installation

These steps only need to be taken if you are installing Brii for the first time. If you are simply updating Brii to a later version, jump straight to [Updating](#updating).

### Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

This package is required for Mod Organizer 2, and you can download it from [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads). Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019." [Direct link](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) if you can't find it.

### Steam Library

If you have your Steam Library in Program Files, read and follow [this](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide) to put it somewhere else. Support will _not be provided_ to users who have their Skyrim installation in a Program Files folder. Folders such as Documents, Downloads, Desktop, or OneDrive are not acceptable places to move your Skyrim installation! Install your Steam Library to a drive's root, such as `C:\Steam Library`.
