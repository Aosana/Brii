# Introduction

"Qethsegol vahrukiv paaz kulaas Yrsa, wo ensosin pah do Taazokaan voth ek Dun ahrk **brii**." - Word Wall for _Dun,_ part of the Elemental Fury Shout.

Brii is a Wabbajack modlist for The Elder Scrolls V: Anniversary Edition that is built and balanced around [SimonMagus616](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746)'s suite of mods. With a plethora of vanilla-styled graphical enhancements, quest expansions, dialogue additions, and gameplay overhauls, Brii offers a relatively simplistic overhaul of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition that does not stray too far from the vanilla game.

# List Contents

Brii contains nearly 1,000 mods that have been patched and tested extensively with one another. For a full list of the mods found in Brii, check out the Load Order Library [here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/brii)!

# System Specs

I play Brii with the following computer specs:

Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 5700G with Radeon Graphics @ 3.80 GHz
RAM: 32 GB
Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080

I get a consistent 60 FPS at every location in the game; however, your mileage may vary depending on your own hardware. If you have issues with performance, please let me know as I may be able to help you!
