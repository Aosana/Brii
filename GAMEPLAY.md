## Perks

[Adamant - A Perk Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191) is Brii's perk mod of choice, with its Bard Perks Addon and [Hand to Hand - An Adamant Add-On](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790) fleshing out and refining the available perks even more. Adamant increases the available perks by a small amount, but SimonMagus616, its author, carefully avoids bloat, sprawl, and power creep by balancing its selection of perks around vanilla perk gain. Many perks that require perk points in vanilla or other perk overhauls, such as all the Dual Casting perks from the magic schools, are given to the player at the start of the game, allowing perk choice to become more meaningful and allowing the player more options in their builds as soon as they begin playing. The Bard Perks and Hand to Hand add-ons allow new builds to flourish; you can be a bard buffing yourself and your allies before a big fight, or you can be a brawler who runs in alone against a horde of enemies.

[Stormcrown - A Shout Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90659) and [The Dragon Cult - Priesthood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92794) take advantage of [Custom Skills Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41780) to add their own perk trees into the game, alongside unique ways to obtain those perks. Stormcrown grants you perks within its Dragonborn-oriented skill tree for every set amount of dragons slain, and Priesthood introduces a new archetype of character, the Dragon Priest, who gains power by slaying Draugr whilst wearing a Dragon Priest mask.

## Spells

[Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) completely changes the boring vanilla magic system into something that is simultaneously more interesting and more balanced. Brii also uses the Jump Spells Addon and the Survival Spells Addon for additional magical utility. For a full breakdown of Mysticism's changes, read its mod page! Just know that Restoration's poison spells are more viable and the Illusion school of magic as a whole is much, _much_ better.

[Natura](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77826) adds nature-based spells, [Lunaris](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80852) adds moon-based spells, [Abyss](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83329) adds shadow-based spells, [Bloodmoon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84304) adds blood-based spells, [Flames of Coldharbour](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85425) adds Coldfire-based spells, [Necrom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86292) adds Apocrypha-based spells, [Stellaris](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86833) adds cosmic-based spells, [Vulcano](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88689) adds volcano-based spells, [Arclight](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90405) adds lightning-based spells, [Desecration](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90832) adds necromancy-based spells, and [Arcane](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91602) adds Magnus-based spells. Seriously, [Darenii](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5073294) has created so many cool and unique Mysticism-balanced spell packs that I cannot reasonably dedicate the time to explain how interesting they are and how much variety they add to builds. Try them all!

Supplementing these magic overhauls and spell packs is [Sorcerer - A Staff and Scroll Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95196)! With the ability to craft staves and scrolls, warriors, rouges, archers, and all can enjoy the power of Aetherius and beyond without being forced to invest in Magicka upon leveling up. Watch your carry weight, though!

## Combat

[Blade and Blunt - A Combat Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549) provides a fresh spin on vanilla combat, making all combative encounters more dangerous and rewarding if played well. Stamina management becomes almost as important as health management, and injuries can severely impact your chances of survival if they are not taken care of by sleeping. I highly advise that you read through Blade and Blunt's mod page yourself for a better idea of what it changes!

[Arena - An Encounter Zone Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487), [Encounter Zones Unlocked AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19608), and [Locational Encounter Zones](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85212) all provide additional changes and challenges relating to Skyrim's encounter zone feature. To put it simply, enemies like dragon priests will be a serious threat at lower levels, and you can't just visit hard dungeons at lower levels to ensure an easier fight later down the line. 

Brii includes many enemy overhauls that mesh well with Blade and Blunt's combat changes! 

- [Dragon War - A Dragon Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310) completely changes how you'll go about fighting dragons, as they no longer have obvious weaknesses and will no longer be forced to stay grounded when at low health.
- [King-Priest - Enhanced Dragon Priests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59652) changes the pitiful Dragon Priests into something to be feared and respected. Don't go to Shearpoint without a plan, unless you really are confident in fighting a dragon and its priest simultaneously!
- [The Dragon Cult - A Draugr Overhaul ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81422) adds much-needed variety to these Nord warriors of a bygone era, and it also ensures that you won't steamroll Nordic ruins at higher levels.
- [Lawless - A Bandit Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88080) completely changes how banditry functions in the land of Skyrim. There are a plethora of new bandit types for you to encounter on your journey, and they will stay a constant challenge even as you yourself grow in power. Thanks to[Bandit Lines Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63733), you can hear all these new bandits jeering at you, mourning their fallen comrades, and more!
- [Hokoron - An Enemy Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89212) provides new level variants for enemies such as Hagravens, Wispmothers, Frost Giants, Falmer, Dwarven Automatons, Rieklings, Ash Spawn, Gargoyles, Seekers, and Lurkers. It also changes some of these creatures' resistances and damage output!
- [Coven - Enemy Witches Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51596) makes witches much more dangerous, and also provides fashionable new outfits to them for you to wear yourself, if you so please.
- [Forsworn Skinchangers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34900) and [Forsworn Gravesingers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40143) provide new Forsworn enemy types. Skinchangers are werewolves and werebears that begin appearing in Forsworn areas at level 14, and Gravesingers are necromancy-practicing Forsworn that can rarely exist alongside, and resurrect, their companions. Part of [Forsworn and Thalmor Lines Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80188) provides more depth and dialogue to the neglected Forsworn, as well.
