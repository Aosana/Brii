## Perks

[Adamant - A Perk Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191) is Brii's perk mod of choice, with its Bard Perks Addon and [Hand to Hand - An Adamant Add-On](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790) fleshing out and refining the available perks even more. Adamant increases the available perks by a small amount, but SimonMagus616, its author, carefully avoids bloat, sprawl, and power creep by balancing its selection of perks around vanilla perk gain. Many perks that require perk points in vanilla or other perk overhauls, such as all the Dual Casting perks from the magic schools, are given to the player at the start of the game, allowing perk choice to become more meaningful and allowing the player more options in their builds as soon as they begin playing. The Bard Perks and Hand to Hand add-ons allow new builds to flourish; you can be a bard buffing yourself and your allies before a big fight, or you can be a brawler who runs in alone against a horde of enemies.

[Stormcrown - A Shout Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90659) and [The Dragon Cult - Priesthood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92794) take advantage of [Custom Skills Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41780) to add their own perk trees into the game, alongside unique ways to obtain those perks. Stormcrown grants you perks within its Dragonborn-oriented skill tree for every set amount of dragons slain, and Priesthood introduces a new archetype of character, the Dragon Priest, who gains power by slaying Draugr whilst wearing a Dragon Priest mask.
